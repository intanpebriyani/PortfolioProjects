## 📌 Introduction

This portfolio contains various dashboards I've built as part of my learning journey and professional growth. Each project has a unique analysis goal—from monitoring Adidas sales, visualizing global population trends, to analyzing annual sales performance at Jatex.

I used effective data visualization techniques to transform raw numbers into interactive, decision-supporting dashboards.
